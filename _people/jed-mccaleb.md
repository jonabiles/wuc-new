##### Quotes on Stellar
On how <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/stellar-ceo-want-real-enough-dot-com-bubble-pops/">Stellar works</a>:

“Stellar is an open protocol for payments. If there’s a digital dollar, there needs to be a real one somewhere. That’s what Stellar does. We have a Stellar consensus protocol. BTC uses proof of work. It’s an extremely expensive process. We have a way more efficient system. Not everybody has to agree on who you trust on the network.

The creators of the internet didn’t predict Wikipedia or airBNB. And that’s what we are. We’re a platform that allows a lot of creativity and enormous opportunities.”
